📄 Data Deletion Request Policy for DrinkLyze App
This policy outlines the procedure for users of the DrinkLyze mobile application to request the deletion of their personal and application-related data, in compliance with Google Play Developer Program policies.

1. About DrinkLyze Data
The DrinkLyze application, operated by [Omer Ozdemir / ozdemir.omer445@gmail.com], is primarily an anonymous utility tool. We do not require or collect personal identifying information such as names, email addresses (except for contact/support requests), or phone numbers.

The data we process and store are:

Anonymous User ID: The unique, non-personal Android ID associated with your device, used to identify your application instance.

Application Data: Your accumulated Credit Balance and the Analysis History (including the analyzed drink name, score, and the image saved locally on your device).

2. How to Request Data Deletion
To submit a data deletion request, you must follow the steps below:

Step 1: Identify Your Account
Because we do not use email/password accounts, you must identify your device instance.

Go to your phone's Settings.

Find the Android ID (Device ID) of the device where you use DrinkLyze.

(You may need to use a third-party app or developer settings to retrieve this ID.)

Step 2: Send the Request via Email
Send an email to our official developer support address:

Email Address: ozdemir.omer445@gmail.com

Subject Line: DRINKLYZE DATA DELETION REQUEST - [Your Android ID]

Body: Clearly state that you are requesting the permanent deletion of all data associated with the Android ID provided in the subject line.

3. Scope of Data Deletion
Upon receiving a verified request, we will take the following actions:

Data Deleted: All data associated with your Anonymous User ID will be permanently purged from our Firebase Firestore and Firebase Realtime Database servers, including your credit balance and analysis history records.

Local Data: This request does not automatically delete the analysis photos saved locally on your device. You must manually delete the application and clear its local storage from your device settings.

Retention: We will delete all identified data within 30 days of receiving a valid request.

4. Retained Data (Exceptions)
We may retain certain data for limited periods or indefinitely only if required for:

Legal Compliance: Records required by tax, accounting, or consumer protection laws (e.g., records related to in-app purchases).

Fraud Prevention: Data necessary for security or fraud prevention purposes.
